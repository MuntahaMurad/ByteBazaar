# ByteBazaar

A modern e‑commerce web application showcasing a complete online store experience—from product discovery to checkout—implemented as a classic PHP multi‑page app.

## What the Project Does

ByteBazaar delivers the end‑to‑end shopping journey and the core capabilities expected from a contemporary online store:

- **Product Catalog & Discovery**: Category and product detail pages with images and descriptions to help shoppers evaluate items.
- **Shopping Cart & Wishlist**: Add, update, and remove items; persist selections; optionally save favourites for later (e.g., `cart.php`, `wishlist.php`).
- **Checkout Experience**: Guided checkout flow to capture customer, shipping and payment details (e.g., `checkout.php`).
- **Orders & Inventory**: Server‑side logic to create orders, track status, and manage inventory (e.g., `inventory.php`).
- **Customer Account Views**: Profile and order history pages (where implemented) for post‑purchase transparency.
- **Media & Assets**: Dedicated product imagery and static assets to support merchandising (`website/img/products`, `website/product_images`).

## Technology & Design (Conceptual)

- **Presentation Layer**: PHP‑based multi‑page routes (e.g., `cart.php`, `sproduct.php`, `checkout.php`) render server‑generated HTML for fast first‑paint and predictable navigation.
- **Business Logic**: Server‑side handlers manage catalog data, cart mutations, order creation and inventory updates.
- **Data Layer**: Designed with a relational schema in mind (typical MySQL/MariaDB deployment), modeling products, categories, users, orders and order items.
- **Static Assets**: Composer‑style foldering for product images and UI media to keep content organized and cache‑friendly.
- **Extensibility**: The code layout accommodates common e‑commerce enhancements such as coupons, ratings/reviews, search and analytics.

## Why It Matters

- **For Learners**: Demonstrates a clear, approachable full‑stack e‑commerce pattern using PHP—ideal for coursework, internships or portfolio projects.
- **For Developers**: A pragmatic foundation for customising storefront features without a heavy framework.
- **For Product Teams**: A quick way to prototype merchandising flows, content placement and checkout UX.

## Non‑Goals & Assumptions

- The repository focuses on illustrating end‑to‑end e‑commerce flows rather than production‑grade security, compliance or scalability.
- Payment, shipping and tax integrations are implementation‑dependent and can be adapted to local market needs.
- Any admin features are illustrative and may need hardening and role‑based access for real‑world deployments.
